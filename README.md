# Requirements Analyst Agent (LangChain + Ollama)

Analyze e-commerce user stories and extract testable requirements using LangChain with a local Ollama model. The agent can output fast, structured TEXT analysis and convert it to a strict JSON schema for assignment submissions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Fast structured analysis (TEXT)**: Clearly formatted sections for requirements.
- **JSON conversion**: Convert TEXT output into the assignment's JSON schema with IDs and defaults.
- **Robust handling**: Retries, timeouts, deterministic fallback, and flexible parsing for bullet styles.
- **Edge-case tests**: Built-in test runner to validate input handling.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama installed and running locally (with the `llama3` model pulled)
- Git (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Assignment1
```

### 2. Install Ollama and pull model

Install Ollama from `https://ollama.com`. After installation:

```bash
# Start Ollama service (if not already running)
ollama serve

# Pull an LLM model (recommended)
ollama pull llama3
```

### 3. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. (Optional) Environment Variables

Copy the template if you plan to add API keys later:

```bash
# Windows
copy env_template.txt .env

# macOS/Linux
cp env_template.txt .env
```

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the main script to analyze a sample e-commerce user story using Ollama locally:

```bash
python main.py
```

This runs a built-in demo that extracts functional/non-functional requirements, edge cases, and gaps. It prints the TEXT analysis, the converted JSON, and saves both to files.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from main import RequirementsAnalyst

analyst = RequirementsAnalyst()
user_story = "As a customer, I want to add products to my shopping cart and modify quantities, so that I can purchase multiple items in a single order."
acceptance_criteria = """
- User can add products to cart from product detail page
- User can update item quantities in the cart
- User can remove items from the cart
- Cart displays total price including tax
- Cart persists during the user session
- Maximum 10 items of any single product allowed
- Out-of-stock items cannot be added to cart
- Cart shows item availability status
- User receives confirmation when items are added/removed
"""
print(analyst.analyze_user_story(user_story, acceptance_criteria))
```

Convert TEXT to JSON:

```python
text = analyst.analyze_user_story(user_story, acceptance_criteria)
json_result = analyst.text_to_json_converter(text, user_story)
```

```python
from main import RequirementsAnalystAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = RequirementsAnalystAgent()

# Analyze your requirements
user_input = """
I need a mobile app for food delivery that allows:
- Users to browse restaurants and menus
- Place orders with customizations
- Track delivery in real-time
- Rate and review restaurants
- Payment processing
"""

# Get comprehensive analysis
result = agent.analyze_requirements(user_input)

# Generate formatted document
document = agent.generate_requirements_document(result)
print(document)
```

### Example Output (abridged)

## üß™ API Reference

All methods below are in `main.py` within `RequirementsAnalyst`.

- `analyze_user_story(user_story: str, acceptance_criteria: str) -> str`
  - Returns TEXT analysis with four sections. Handles input validation, retries, and timeouts.

- `text_to_json_converter(analysis_text: str, original_user_story: str) -> dict`
  - Parses TEXT into JSON schema. Supports headers with `:` or `-`, and bullets `‚Ä¢`, `-`, `*`. Applies defaults.

- `_parse_plain_text_sections(text: str) -> dict`
  - Internal: splits text into sections and bullet lines.

- `_infer_nfr_type(description: str) -> str`
  - Internal: infers NFR type from keywords.

- `_json_to_text(data: dict) -> str`
  - Internal: converts JSON back to TEXT sections.

- `validate_assignment_requirements(data: dict) -> dict`
  - Validates at least 10 total items, ID formats, and schema completeness.

### CLI Test Runner
- Run edge tests: `python -X utf8 main.py --test`
  - Tests empty, very short, malformed AC, very long, and emojis/special characters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üìù License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

1. Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve` (or background service)
2. Pull the model: `ollama pull llama3`
3. Reinstall deps if imports fail: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Windows encoding issues: run with `python -X utf8 main.py`.
5. Empty outputs: ensure the model is running; deterministic fallback will still produce text and JSON, but counts may be low.
6. Bullet parsing: use headings with `:` or `-`, and bullets `‚Ä¢`, `-`, or `*`.

## ‚úÖ Validation Criteria (Assignment)

Your submission should satisfy:
- At least 10 total requirements across functional, non-functional, edge cases, and gaps
- Proper ID formats: `FR###`, `NFR###`, `EC###`
- All required fields present per schema
- Valid, parsable JSON (for the JSON output)

## üîó Dependencies

- `langchain`
- `langchain-ollama`
- `python-dotenv`

## üìà Future Enhancements

- [ ] Web interface for easier interaction
- [ ] Support for multiple LLM providers
- [ ] Export to different document formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with project management tools
- [ ] Custom agent training capabilities
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features

## ‚úÖ Requirements Engineering Best Practices

- Use MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won‚Äôt) for stakeholder alignment
- Maintain traceability from user stories ‚Üí requirements ‚Üí test cases ‚Üí defects
- Ensure each requirement is SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Separate functional vs non-functional requirements; make NFRs measurable (e.g., response time, uptime)
- Capture edge cases and negative scenarios early; design for validation and error handling
- Reference standards: [IEEE 29148 Requirements Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7100875) and [BABOK](https://www.iiba.org/babok-guide/)

## üß† NLP Techniques for Business Analysis

- Keyword and keyphrase extraction (e.g., RAKE, TextRank) for initial signal
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify actors, products, locations
- Dependency parsing and chunking to extract action-object structures ("add product", "update quantity")
- Pattern-based extraction for constraints (max/min, limits, response times)
- Classification to separate Functional vs Non-Functional requirements
- Similarity search to detect duplicates/overlaps and map to acceptance criteria
